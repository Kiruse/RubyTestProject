# RubyTestProject
A test project to showcase my ability to learn and use a (to me) new language - in this case Ruby (On Rails).

## Edit
Processing of this task started on Sun, 23rd July 2017, around 10am and ended on Mon. 24th July 2017 around 11pm.
The process also includes time to learn Ruby and get (somewhat) familiar with Ruby on Rails. I am well aware that
the techniques used here are imperfect.

I did take multiple-hour-long breaks in between, of course.
